## INSPIRATION ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72274851/218500470-ec078b99-0a50-4b06-a2df-c09e47ecc187.png)

Lung cancer is a serious and common disease that affects millions of people around the world. It is caused by genetic damage to the cells in the lungs, often due to smoking or exposure to harmful substances. Lung cancer can cause symptoms such as difficulty breathing, coughing up blood, chest pain, hoarseness, headache and weight loss. Lung cancer can be diagnosed by various tests such as X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, PET scans, sputum cytology and biopsy. Lung cancer can be treated by surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, depending on the type and stage of the cancer.

The inspiration for doing this project on lung cancer is to raise awareness about this disease and its prevention. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, but many people are unaware of its risk factors and symptoms. By doing this project on lung cancer, we can educate people about how to reduce the risk of developing lung cancer by quitting smoking, avoiding passive smoking and carcinogens at work. You can also inform people about the importance of early detection and treatment of lung cancer, which can improve survival rates and quality of life.

## What It Does ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72274851/218503394-b52dfcc9-0620-4f44-94f5-46a09a5cc970.png)

Lung cancer prediction using 9 machine learning classification models using Scikit-learn library in Python is a code implementation that aims to develop a predictive model for detecting lung cancer in patients. The code uses 9 different machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, Gaussian naive Bayes, multinomial naive Bayes, support vector classifier, random forest, multi-layer perceptron, and gradient boosting classifier, to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on a range of variables. The dataset used in the code includes various columns such as gender, age, smoking, yellow fingers, anxiety, peer pressure, chronic disease, fatigue, allergy, wheezing, alcohol consuming, coughing, shortness of breath, swallowing difficulty, chest pain, and lung cancer. By analyzing these variables and using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and correlations, the predictive models can provide accurate assessments of a patient's risk of developing lung cancer.

## How I built it ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72274851/218502434-f6e66043-0db0-4f85-b7f4-f33b2d33df1f.png)

### ✅ First I Import libraries

### ✅Understand the data

### ✅Create a Correlation and visualize it

### ✅Test Different Models

### ✅Train the models using Intel oneDAL to get better results and faster computation(Intel oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL))

✅Building application using intel oneDAL:The Intel oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL) contributes to the acceleration of big data analysis by providing highly optimised algorithmic building blocks for all phases of data analytics (preprocessing, transformation, analysis, modelling, validation, and decision making) in batch, online, and distributed processing modes of computation.The library optimizes data ingestion along with algorithmic computation to increase throughput and scalability.

✅Building a lung cancer detection application involves a significant amount of research and development. During the process, I likely learned a number of things.

✅Machine Learning: I likely learned about different machine learning algorithms and how they can be applied to detect lung cancer.

✅Data Analysis: I likely gained experience in collecting and analyzing large amounts of data to train our machine learning models.

✅Collaboration: Building a project like this likely required collaboration with a team of experts in various fields, machine learning, and data analysis, and I likely learned the importance of working together to achieve common goals.

These are just a few examples of the knowledge and skills that i likely gained while building this project. 
Overall, building a lung cancer application is a challenging and rewarding experience that requires a combination of technical expertise and knowledge.
